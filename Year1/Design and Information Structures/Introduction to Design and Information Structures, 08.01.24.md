**What is efficiency?**

A solution is deemed efficient if it solves the problem within the required resource constraints of space and time, in this module we will focus more on time. 

The cost of a solution is the amount of resources that the solution consumes, this cost is usually measured in terms of time.

**Misconception of data structures**

Each data structure has its own cost and benefits, rarely is one data structure is going to be better than another in all situations, a data structure requires space for each data item it stores, time to perform a basic operation and programming effort.

**What is an abstract data type?**

A type is a collection of values, such as Boolean having values true or false. A data type is a type together with a collection of operations to manipulate the type. For example an integer variable is a member of the integer data type and addition is an example of an operation of the integer type. 

An Abstract Data Type is a set of values and a set of operations on the data type. Furthermore an ADT does not specify how the data type is implemented.

For example the Boolean type as an ADT: A set of values (True, False): Booleans and the operations Boolean AND Boolean = Boolean

**What is a data structure?**

A data structure if the implementation of an ADT, each operation associated with the ADT is implemented by one or more subroutines in the implementation.

The term data structure usually refers to data stored in a computer's main memory.

The related term file structure often refers to the organization of data in secondary storage, such as a disk drive.

**What is a problem?**

A problem is a task to be performed, some problems can be viewed as a function in the mathematical sense, for example a function is a matching between inputs and outputs, a particular input must always result in the same output every time the function is computed

**What is an algorithm?**

An algorithm is a method to solve a problem, an algorithm is going to take the input to a problem and transforms it to the output and a problem can have many algorithms, but a given algorithm solves only one problem. 

A program is an instance of an algorithm in a specific programming language.

**What are the properties of an algorithm?**

An algorithm possesses the following properties:

- It must be correct
- It must be composed of a series of concrete steps
- It must be composed of a finite number of steps
- It must terminate

**What are examples of algorithmic paradigms**

- Brute force
- Greedy
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Backtracking
- Branch and bound

**How to determine the efficiency of an algorithm?**

- Exactness
- Time
- Space
