**What are the notations of commonly known sets

	Natural numbers, {0,1,2,3,4,5,6...}:

$$\mathbb{N}$$

	Integers, {0,-1,1,-2,2...}:

$$\mathbb{Z}$$

		Irrationals, {pi,e,golden ratio}:

$$\mathbb{Q}$$

	Real numbers, {pi,-1,10,e}:

$$\mathbb{R}$$

	Complex numbers, {sqrt(-1)}:

$$\mathbb{C}$$

**What is a set

	A set is a mathematical object with a notion of membership and is identified by {} and order doesn't matter:

$$\{a,b\} = \{b,a\}$$

**What is a notion of membership

	Membership is denoted by the symbol:

$$a \in B$$

	This means that there is an element "a" that is in the set "B"

**What is a subset

	A subset is when one set's elements are the exact same as another set where the other set can have elements that are not in the other set but the other set's elements are the exact same to some degree. The notation is:

$$A = \{1,2,3,4\} $$
 $$B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} $$
 $$A\subseteq B$$

**What is the empty set

	The empty set is a set that has no elements and goes by the notation:

$$\emptyset$$
**Special properties of the empty set

	One property is that an element is never going to be a member of the empty set
	
	Another property is that the empty set is the subset of all sets, this can proved by contradiction. Suppose the empty set wasnt a subset of a set A, that will mean that there is an element in the empty set that is not in the set A, however the empty set cannot have an element which is a contradiction which means that the empty set is the subset of all sets.

**What is cardinality

	Carinality is checking how many elements are in a set and it doesn't include duplicates

$$ | \{1,2,3,4\} | = 4 $$
$$ | \{1,2,3,4,4\} | = 4 $$
