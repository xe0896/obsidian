**What is a proposition

	A statement which is either true or false and it cannot be both. 

	For example:
	1 + 1 = 2
	Is it raining
	Pigs can fly

	These are propositions as they are either true or false

**Statements that are not a proposition

	How are you
	This statement is false
	x = 5 - since this depends on x, may be 5 or not

**What is an atomic proposition

	A atomic proposition is a proposition that cannot be expressed in simpler terms such as, "The grass is green", you cannot break this sentence more to create more propositions. However if the sentence was "The grass was green and the snow was white", then you can break the sentence into two different propositons meaning that the statement is not an atomic proposition.

**What is a compound proposition

	A compound proposition is made out of boolean logic such as AND, OR, NOT.
	AND - conjunction
	OR - disjunction
	NOT - negation

	XOR, NAND and implication are others are also acceptable.

**What is syntax

	Syntax is logical representation this is relevant as something like:
	P AND AND Q is not syntactically correct.

**What is semantics

	The meaning attached to our syntax.

$$\mathbb{B}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$$

	If n = 3 then we will have 3 boolean values that outputs one boolean, this can be seen in a truth table for p AND q which is when n = 2 since there are two inputs and results to one output (if both p and q are true).
