**Different proofs

	1) Induction
	2) Exhausation
	3) Counter example (not great)
	4) Contradiction
	5) Contra-positive
	6) Direct

**Example of a disproof

	Every integer is even, if we were to bring up a number that is odd such as 3, this will not be considered a proof but a disproof.

**Proof by contra-positive

	Prove if 7x + 10 is odd then x is odd can be re-written as if x is even then 7x + 10 is even.

$$p \rightarrow q = ¬q \rightarrow ¬p$$
