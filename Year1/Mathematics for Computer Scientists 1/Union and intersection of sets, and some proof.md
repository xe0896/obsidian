**Union of a set notation**

	This union symbol will start at 1 and go up to 5

$$\bigcup_{i=1}^{5}A_{i} = A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup A_{3}\cup A_{4}\cup A_{5}$$
$$A_{i} = \{x \in \mathbb{N} \mid x \leq i \}$$

$$A_{1} = \{0\}$$
$$A_{2} = \{0,1\}$$
$$A_{3} = \{0,1,2\}$$
$$A_{4} = \{0,1,2,3\}$$
$$A_{5} = \{0,1,2,3,4\}$$

	Due to the union the answer will be A5

**Intersection of a set notation**

	The intersection has the same logic but it will look for the elements that are in every set

$$\bigcap_{i=1}^{5}A_{i} = A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3}\cap A_{4}\cap A_{5}$$

	This will output:

$$A_{1}$$ 

	As 0 is in every set and the intersection creates a set that includes elements that every set has which is 0
