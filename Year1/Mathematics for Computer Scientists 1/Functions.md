**What is a function

	A function is some rule such that every x \in X is assigned one ambigiuous value y \in Y by the rule

$$ f: X \rightarrow Y $$

	X is in this case will be the domain and Y will be the co-domain.
	X represents the inputs of the function and Y represents the possible outcomes that can be received by the inputs X.

**What is the sign function

$$\mathbb{R} \rightarrow (-1,0,1)$$

**Restricting the domain

	With functions sometimes the domain will have to be restricted in order to fulfil a certain requirement, this requirement can be things such that x must be in the reals so for example:

$$f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
$$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$

	This cannot be a function as since x can be any real number and it the output must be a real number, so if x where to be a negative number which is still a real number then the output will be a complex number which is not in the real domain.

	To counter this we can make the real domain restricted to only allow positve real numbers:

$$\mathbb{R}_{x\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{x\geq 0}$$

	Another example is that sometimes a function with one input lead to two outputs:

$$f(x)=\pm \sqrt{ x^2+3 }$$

	One way to counter this is by making the + or - removed by removing either one or we can change the co-domain (output)

$$\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R^{2}}$$

	This makes the output become $$x^{2}+3$$.
