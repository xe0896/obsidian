**What is a sequence

	A sequence is a mathematical object with a notion of position, meaning that the order the sequence matters.

**What is a singleton

	A singleton is where there is a set within a set

$$ \{\{a\}\} $$
**What is a nth tuple

	Used in sequences, a sequence with cardinality of 10 is a 10th tuple

**What is a unit

	A sequence with cardinality of 1

**How to multiply sets together

	When multiplying sets, you create another set that has sequences inside:

$$X = \{a,b\}$$
$$X^{2}=X \times X$$
$$X^{2} = \{(a,a),(a,b),(b,a),(b,b)\}$$

	Also went multiplying sets we can figure out the cardinality of the product of two sets by taking the cardinality of the two sets we multiply and times them together

$$|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$$
**Interval notation

$$[x,y]$$
$$[x;y]$$

	The set above that doesn't have a semi colon shows the elements between the interval x and y and not including x and y. However the semi-colon one does include x and y.
