 **What is a predicate

	A function that outputs a true or false value

$$P(a,b,c..) = \mathbb{B} $$


**How may something not be a predicate

	If there is no input to it but a fixed input such as:

$$dow(Monday)$$

	This has a fixed input of Monday which even though it may still output false, it has no input meaning it is not deemed as a predicate

	Another example:

$$f(x) = x+4$$

	There is no boolean value attached to this as it is just a normal function.

	Another example:

$$1>5$$

	Even if this is false there is no variables that can change meaning the 1st and this one are called propositons.

	Another example:

$$f(x) = T$$

	This is still a predicate as it has an input x and it outputs a boolean value.

**For all and there exist notation

	For all (universal):

$$\forall$$

	There exists (existential):

$$\exists$$
