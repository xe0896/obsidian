**What is recursion

	When a method calls itself, and we must have a terminating condition which is known as a base case which allows the method to not run forever, however Java will disallow the method to get out of hand by throwing a stack overflow error.

	Common error messages:

	Symbol not found - this means that a variable is used that doesn't exist, or hasn't been declared, this can also happen if you write a method wrong
