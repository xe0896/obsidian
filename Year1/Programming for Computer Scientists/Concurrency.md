**What is a thread?**

	A thread is a mechanism that runs a task
		It consists of some series of actions that run start to end
	Java uses threads but so far we've been writing using a single thread but Java allows us to create our own threads with out programs

	This is called multi-threading and is how Java allows us to do concurrency
