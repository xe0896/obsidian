 	Also known as playing with 0s and 1s

**Boolean Logic

	NOT gate, takes in one input and creates the inverse of the input.

	AND gate, takes in two inputs and only outputs 1 if both of the inputs are 1.

	OR, takes in two inputs and outputs 1 if atleast any of the two inputs are 1.

	XOR, takes in two inputs and known as exclusive OR, if the two inputs are the same (0 and 0 or 1 and 1) then outputs 0, else outputs 1

**Chips

	A chip in real life is much more complex then the diagram below, this is to make it more clearer on the functions that the chip offers.

	The semi-circle on the top allows us to identify where the top of the chip is.

	The pin numbered 7 is the ground pin which means it has 0 voltage
	The pin numbered 14 is the high/VCC pin which has a higher voltage then the ground pin

**Different ways to represent gates

**Properties of NAND, NOR gates

	All gates can be presented using NAND gates or NOR gates. This is useful for manufacturers as they can bulk buy components of NAND gates and use them to create other gates such as AND, XOR, OR. This allows them to save money

**Karnaugh Maps

	Don't care are represented with an X which can be 0 or 1 and doesn't matter what the value is as it is seen as a value that shouldnt be considered in the first place. This is represented with an X and is shown in the Karnaugh map and it can be included in the bubble or not. Try both and see if the solution is more simplified if you do include the X or not.
