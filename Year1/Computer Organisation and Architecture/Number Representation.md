**Computational Numbers

	Computers use signals which is represented as 0 or 1:
		Therefore, we use bits - base 2 (0 and 1)

	To make things more easier to write, we use Octal - Base 8 (0 to 7)
		or Hex which is base 16

**Base

	This formula is used to calculate any base, where N is the number of columns, i is the index of position and symbol is the digit at position i

**Word sizes

	Word are the number of bits that can be processed simultaneously
	
	Bigger the word size the more computation we can do:
		Bigger the number we can store
		More instructions we can call upon
		More data we can transfer in one go


**Conversion
	
	In order to convert denary to binary the steps are:
		Divide the number by the base required
		Record the remainder
		Repeat
