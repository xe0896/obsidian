# Obsidian Vault Documentation
## Purpose
The purpose of this is to documentation is to organise my work and have a resource that i can fall back on to remind myself on the stuff I've worked on, namely their implementations. 

The reason why this is a GitHub repo is so I can easily transfer this between my two workstations as I am not purchasing Obsidian Sync and I've made this public as some people do use this resource. 
## Approach
The stuff that I document may seem a bit random, in terms of there relationships with one another. They are contained within their folders and structural well. 
### leetcode/
Each LeetCode problem is broken down into:
- A clear understanding of the problem statement.
- Identification of key patterns and insights.
- Optimal and alternative solutions with explanations.
- Reasoning behind the chosen solution.
- Key edge cases and pitfalls to watch out for.
### projects/
For my projects, I include:
- Clear descriptions of what the project does and its goals.
- Architectural design and key technical decisions.
- Code structure and important implementation notes.
- Installation guides, usage tips, and troubleshooting advice.
### js/jsx/html/haskell..
These are just concise tutorials of the said programming language that are from other resources, just something that I can always refer back to and have some connection to since i made it. This is definitely necessary if you want to learn well as it will enable reinforcement learning and without having something to rely on when you forget about stuff on a language (which will always happen) is nice.
### data structures
This one stands out a bit from the rest, this is just documenting the behaviour of data structures that I founded interesting, mainly would be data structures that could be seen as "difficult" to implement. 

I'd say implementing different data structures and populating them with big data and querying them is definitely very interesting to me as they truly show the pros and cons of a data structure.
### Roadmap
There are many things I want to do and will definitely be documented here so outlining on what the things i do want to do could motivate me:
- [ ] Learn Haskell, make a game with it
- [ ] Learn different web services (AWS)
- [ ] Outline 5 different data structures
- [ ] Create Pokemon information website with React
- [ ] Document JavaScript heavily
- [ ] Document HTML and CSS (mostly have prior knowledge)
- [ ] 100 total Leetcodes
