# Obsidian Vault Documentation

## Purpose

This vault is my go-to place for organizing:

- **LeetCode problems**: Breaking down each problem to help me understand the core concepts and quickly recall solutions.
    
- **Project docs**: Documenting my projects, including their architecture, decisions, and implementation details for easy future reference.

### LeetCode Problems

Each LeetCode problem is broken down into:

- A clear understanding of the problem statement.
    
- Identification of key patterns and insights.
    
- Optimal and alternative solutions with explanations.
    
- Reasoning behind the chosen solution.
    
- Key edge cases and pitfalls to watch out for.
    

### Project Documentation

For my projects, I include:

- Clear descriptions of what the project does and its goals.
    
- Architectural design and key technical decisions.
    
- Code structure and important implementation notes.
    
- Installation guides, usage tips, and troubleshooting advice.
    

## Structure

The vault is organized into two main sections:

- `DevDocs/Leetcode/` → All the problem breakdowns and solutions.
    
- `DevDocs/Projects/` → Detailed technical docs for my personal projects.
    

This setup helps me keep everything organized and easy to reference whenever I need it.
