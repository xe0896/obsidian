# Obsidian Vault Documentation  

## Purpose  
This vault serves as a structured documentation system for:  
- **LeetCode questions**: Breaking down problems to gain deeper understanding and ensure instant recall of solutions.  
- **Project documentation**: Clearly explaining project architecture, implementation details, and decisions for future reference.  

## Approach  
### LeetCode Problems  
Each problem is dissected methodically to:  
- Understand the problem statement thoroughly.  
- Identify key insights and patterns.  
- Document optimal and alternative solutions.  
- Explain the reasoning behind the chosen approach.  
- Highlight edge cases and potential pitfalls.  

### Project Documentation  
For projects, the vault includes:  
- Detailed descriptions of project goals and functionalities.  
- Architectural design and technical choices.  
- Code structure and important implementation details.  
- Installation, usage instructions, and troubleshooting notes.  

## Benefits  
- **Clarity**: Forces a structured approach to problem-solving and development.  
- **Retention**: Improves recall by reinforcing concepts through documentation.  
- **Efficiency**: Allows quick reference when revisiting problems or debugging projects.  

## Structure  
The vault is organized with separate sections for:  
- `LeetCode/` → Problem breakdowns and solutions.  
- `Projects/` → Technical documentation for personal projects.  

This structured approach ensures a well-documented, easily navigable knowledge base for both problem-solving and project development.
