You are given an integer array piles where `piles[i]`is the number of bananas in the `i`th pile. You are also given an integer `h`, which represents the number of hours you have to eat all the bananas.

You may decide your bananas-per-hour eating rate of `k`. Each hour, you may choose a pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, you may finish eating the pile but you can not eat from another pile in the same hour.

Return the minimum integer `k` such that you can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

This question is pretty tricky if we keep on thinking of an algorithm to solve this, instead we should think of this for a little while then try to see if we can use simulations instead, to do this we need to find an easy check of our simulated `k` and we would also need an efficient way to find our `k` instead of checking the lower bound of `k` to the upper bound of `k` linearly.

Before we even start thinking about simulations, we need to figure out a lower and upper bound of `k` and we can figure out the lower bound pretty easy as if we are eating at a rate of `k` and want to finish no matter how fast we take, we need a `k >= 1` to actually make some progress.

The upper bound takes some more thought as we need to think more about efficiency, if we have a pile of bananas that is lower than `k` then we can eat all of it in less than one hour and have some hours to spare, but we cannot continue and make use of our spare time as we are told we cannot eat from another pile in the same hour. This means that if we had our maximum banana pile `Math.max(..piles)` then there is no point of `k` being greater then this pile as we are guaranteed to have spare time and we want to avoid spare time as we cannot make use of it. 

Now that we have clarified the lower and upper bound of `k`, we now need a check to see if this `k` would lead to the total hours it took to be lower than `h`, to do this we will need to consider every `piles[i]` and do `Math.ceil(piles[i] / k)` on it see how many hours it is taking for this pile and accumulate the hours into a `sum` variable, which the `sum` variable will be needed to reduce the search space of our lower and upper bound `k`.

The way that we will be reducing our search space of `k` can be done using binary search as the check takes `O(n)` time and binary search takes `log(max(...piles)` leading to a not to shabby `O(nlog(max(...piles)))`. We will be using the `sum` variable to see if this simulated `k` is even valid and we can see if it is valid if `sum <= h` as that implies our simulated `k` has managed to take less time then `h` which is what want, but we want the minimum `k` that does this so if `sum <= h` then `minK = Math.min(minK, k)`:

Leading to the following answer:

```jsx
minEatingSpeed(piles, h) {
    let L = 1;
    let R = Math.max(...piles);
    let minK = R;

    while(L <= R) {
        const k = Math.floor((L + R) / 2);
        let sum = 0;
            
        for(let i = 0; i < piles.length; i++) {
            sum += Math.ceil(piles[i] / k);
        }
        if(sum > h) {
            L = k + 1;
        } else {
            R = k - 1;
            minK = Math.min(minK, k);
        }
    }
    return minK;
}
```
